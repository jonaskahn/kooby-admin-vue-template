## What's news?
- I formatted all the code with prettier >,,,< 
- Now `App Config` will store setting permanently ( to local storage ) to avoid theme reload everytime F5 hit
- I added [`Vue Loading Overlay`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-loading-overlay) to replace the `removed loading` from Sakai
- Add some transitions
- I will try to keep-track with Sakai Vue for every new release.

## Todo
